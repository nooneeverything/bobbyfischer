  <p> Bobby Fischer is still to this day considered one of the best chess players in history. His games even to this day are studied by chess enthusiasts
  all over the world. He is considered a important part of chess being integrated into mainstream culture. His victory in 1972 not only showed the 
  world the value of chess but cemented him in the history of the game forever. Even though his personal life was fulled with controversy  and scandle
  those of us who study the game and its culture cant help but seeing Fischer as a shining example of how the game is supposed to be played, with wisdom
  and grace.
