  US citizen. She was of Polish decent. Regina throughout her life was a teacher, a nurse, and a physician. Regina and Bobbys father divorced
  when Bobby was a toddler. At the time of Bobbys birth. His journey in chess began at age 6 when his sister bought a chess set from
  a candy store. They taught themselves using the instructions from the set. After his sister lost interest, young Fischer became engulfed
  in the game. So much so his mother began to worry about the amount of time he was spending alone playing himself. She even went so fas as
  to put a postcard to the <em> Brooklyn Eagle</em> newspaper seeking to place an ad inquiring if there were any other children who would
  like to play with Bobby. Chess caused a strain between Fischer in his mother who preferred he had other interests besides chess.</p>
